> I do not enlighten those who are not eager to learn, nor arouse those who are not anxious to give an explanation themselves. If I have presented one corner of the square and they cannot come back to me with the other three, I should not go over the points again.

~ Confucius 

I came across the opening quote today while perusing Marijn Haverbeke's book, *Eloquent JavaScript*. As an adult, career-change coder, who has fallen deep down the happy rabbit hole, I must admit that I cannot always produce three corners. Yet. Coding is hard. Is it? I've been told by others not to let myself think of its grand challenges, as standing at the base of a mountain makes its climb seem impossible. It has been suggested that instead, I learn to relish the journey toward the summit and embrace, with ardour, the reality of the climb.
